# Linkbird.ai - Leads & Campaigns Replica (Starter)

This repository is a starter scaffold for the assignment. It includes:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (skeleton)
- Mock API routes under `/app/api/*` to simulate paginated leads & campaigns
- Drizzle ORM schema files and seed script skeleton
- Zustand store and React Query usage in the frontend
- Authentication modal skeleton (Better Auth placeholders)

How to use
1. Run `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

Deliverables included:
- Full project scaffold
- `prisma/seed.js` (mock data generator)
- `db/schema.sql` for reference
- `.env.example`

Notes:
This is a ready-to-run frontend + mock backend scaffold. The Postgres + Drizzle wiring is provided as schema and sample config; you will need to create a database and add credentials to `.env` to enable real DB usage.
